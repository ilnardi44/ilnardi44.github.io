                        On May 10, the crypto world was rocked by the collapse of one of the most famous coin stable of the last period Terra-Luna. <br>
                        <b>But what happened and why?</b> <br><br>
                        The attack, which is estimated to have brought a gain of about $1 billion to the attacker, is based on the use of a short position. <br>
                        But before explaining what a short position is and what happened, I think it is necessary to specify that the attack did not happen to the direct damage the Terra-Luna system, but rather the attacker's main objective was the value of Bitcoin (BTC). <br><br>
                        <b><u>What is a Short position?</u></b><br> 
                        A short position is a type of bet that you can place on the stock market. To take a practical example: letâ€™s say that I borrow 100 balls, which at the time of my acquisition cost $1 per ball, thus having 100$. <br>
                        I bet that the price of the balls will go down. Then I sell my 100 balls and take the $100; the next day, the value of the balls falls to $ 0.80. Then I buy back the 100 balls and return them to the rightful owner, thus earning us 20$. <br><br>
                        Simplifying this is what happened with the Earth-Moon system: the attacker opens a short position with 100,000 BTC and forces the value of these, through the Earth-Moon algorithm, to go down. In doing so he can buy again the 100,000 BTC, which now has a much lower value, and keep us a substantial gain. <br><br>
                        In this news, there are 2 elements of business management that we faced during the course. <br>
                        The first problem we observe is from the part of the provider, in particular from the algorithm used to maintain Terra as a stable coin (that is a coin that always has the value of 1 USD); the second we observe him in the part of the user, that unfortunately, after this attack has lost the savings invested in the system. <br>
                        The first problem is the creation of an algorithm that has not faithfully followed the steps of the problem-solving protocol, going to intervene on the symptom of the problem (The loss of value of Terra) and not directly on the origin (An outside agent who was manipulating the stock market). The algorithm, seeing the price of Terra going down, begins to reinsert liquidity, selling Luna. In doing so, it affects the value of BTC which drops drastically. <br>    
                        However, I do not believe that all the blame lies with the programmers of the algorithm. But the problem is much more at the root of the crypto market, that is, a regulation that protects users from attacks of this kind. <br><br>
                        The second problem concerns the omission of the decision-making process by investors. There are two reasons why the investors may have lost everything. <br>
                        The first reason can be blamed on the company behind the Terra-Luna system because, to keep alive the Anchor algorithm, which manages the stable coin Terra, they had to tempt to leave the cryptocurrency within the system, creating the possibility of creating portfolios with an interest rate of 20%. In doing so, the inexperienced investor, seeing his savings grow in a short time, was little tempted to invest in other coins, investing 100% of their savings in the Terra-Luna system and losing everything with the collapse of the cryptocurrency. <br>
                        The second reason is the result of a phenomenon called panic selling. <br>
                        In a few words, when investors, or those for them, saw the value of Terra dropping so dramatically, they started selling their coins massively; by doing so, they have saved some money from the drop and, at the same time, contributed to the decline in the value of Terra, dragging other investors into the abyss together with them.
